# Familiarisation with Resistor

## Theory

Resistors are fundamental electronic components that restrict the flow of electric current in a circuit. They are crucial for controlling voltage and current levels within electronic devices. In this experiment, you will become familiar with resistors, their types, and how to read their values and tolerance.

## Objectives of Experiment

At the end of the experiment, the student would be able to:
- Explain the function and unit of resistors.
- Measure the value of a resistor.
- Measure the tolerance of a resistor.
- Explain the types of resistors.

## Types of Resistors

Resistors come in various types, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are the common types of resistors:

### Reading Value of Fixed Resistors

Resistors are typically color-coded because they are too small to have their values written on them. There are 4 or 5 color bands that represent the value of a resistor.

#### Reading Value: Step 1

If your resistor has four color bands, turn it so that the gold or silver band is on the right-hand side, or the end with more bands should point to the left.

#### Reading Value: Step 2

The first band on the left represents the first digit. Based on the color of this band, make a note of the digit. For a 4-band resistor, it's '5', and for a 5-band resistor, it's '2'.

#### Reading Value: Step 3

The second band represents the second digit. The colors represent the same numbers as the first digit. For a 4-band resistor, it's '6', and for a 5-band resistor, it's '3'.

#### Reading Value: Step 4

The third band reveals how many zeros to add/divide to the first two numbers for a 4-band resistor. In this case, for a 4-band resistor, it's '4' zeroes to be added, so the value is 560K.

#### Reading Value: Step 5

The third band denotes the 3rd digit for a 5-band resistor. In this case, for a 5-band resistor, it's '7'. So, the value of the 5-band resistor is 237 Ohms, as its multiplier digit is '0'.

### Tolerance

The last band on a resistor denotes its tolerance. For a 4-band resistor, it's +/- 10%, while for a 5-band resistor, it's +/- 1%.

Tolerance is an essential property to consider. For example:
- A 100-ohm resistor with a 10% tolerance can have a value between 90 and 110 Ohms.
- A 120-ohm resistor with a 10% tolerance can have a value between 108 and 132 Ohms. 

There is some overlap between the resistance values due to their tolerance limits.

## Mnemonic to Remember

## Types of Resistors

### Carbon Film Resistors

- Most general-purpose and cost-effective.
- Tolerance of resistance value is usually +/- 5%.
- Power ratings of 1/8 W, 1/4 W, and 1/2 W are commonly used.
- Cons: They tend to be electrically noisy.

### Metal Film Resistor

- Used when higher tolerance is needed, i.e., more precise values.
- Typically have about +/- 0.05% tolerance.

### Wire Wound Resistors

- Made of metal resistance wire, allowing for precise values.
- High wattage resistors can be made using thick wire material.
- Wire wound resistors in a ceramic case are called ceramic resistors.

By understanding the types and value calculation of resistors, you'll be better equipped to work with them in electronic circuits.
